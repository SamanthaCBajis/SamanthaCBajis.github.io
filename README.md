# JavaScript TileMap Generator
This is an HTML tilemap game/generator. Here is the [GitHub Page](https://samanthacbajis.github.io/index.html). Refresh to see the other tilemaps; you may have to click twice or a few times as the maps randomly generate. To do so, either refresh the page or click on the "Tilemap Generator!" header at the top.
